# Rockbuster_SQL_Launch_Strat
## Project Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. The goal of this project
is to answer a series of business questions and produce data-driven answers that they can 
use for their 2020 company strategy
## Key Questions
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
## Data and Tools
● PGAdmin4 - For managing Rockbuster database
● Postgre SQL - For  queries and analysis 
● Tableau - For creating visualizations
